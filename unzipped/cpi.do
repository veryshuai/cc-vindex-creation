*** this file prepares quartely CPI-U indices for deflating NBER data.
*** it uses the file CPIAUCNS.csv (CPI All items, Urban Consumers, Not Seasonally adjusted) which is downloaded
*** (for example, today, 12/24/2009) from http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPIAUCNS/downloaddata?cid=9 .

* NOTICE: last few quarters are NOT to be used, b/c data for, e.g., December 2009 do not exist yet and so quarterly 
* average (cpi_q) for 2009:4 is incorrect. similarly, when averaging over the four consequtive quarters (cpi_q_a), 
* averages for 2009:1 and on are incorrect.
